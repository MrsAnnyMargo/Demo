I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
